The goal of the Diet Analyzer project is to develop an application that is easy to use and understand. The tool will allow users to input their daily food logs by taking images of what they eat and receive insightful feedback about their dietary choices and how it affects their health goals. 

The first critical objective of the project is food identification. Using image recognition technology we will enable the user to simplify the logging process. The application will contain an override feature to help ensure that logs are accurate.

The second object is nutritional data analysis. The application will give the user detailed insights into the macronutrients and micronutrients that they are consuming.

Project start:
